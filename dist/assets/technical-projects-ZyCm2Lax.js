This created a bottleneck, slowed down response times for complex issues, and pulled resources away from proactive customer engagement. We needed a smarter, more scalable way to provide instant answers.",value:"I architected and built an AI-powered chatbot that integrated directly with our core business systems (WooCommerce, LearnDash, and FluentCRM) via Cloudflare Workers. This wasn't just a simple FAQ bot; it was a CRM-aware assistant. It could look up a user's order, understand their training history, and provide personalized guidance based on their specific needs. By handling the majority of common inquiries automatically, the chatbot dramatically improved our self-service rate and increased the quality of support hand-offs to our human team. This system provides a better, faster experience for our users and allows our team to operate far more efficiently.",color:"from-purple-500/20 to-pink-600/20",borderColor:"border-purple-500/30"},{id:"events-hub-tools",title:"Events Hub & Instructor Tools",tagline:"A unified administrative dashboard for data-driven event management and instructor empowerment.",category:"Dashboard & Analytics",icon:"Calendar",technologies:["LearnDash","WooCommerce","FluentCRM","REST API","React"],timeline:"2 months",impact:"60% faster event management workflows",why:"Our events team and instructors were operating in the dark. They lacked a centralized, real-time view of event performance, making it difficult to identify at-risk courses, prepare for attendee needs, or communicate with cohorts effectively. Data was scattered across spreadsheets and different systems, leading to operational inefficiencies and missed opportunities.",value:"I built a unified Events Hub that consolidated data from LearnDash, WooCommerce, and FluentCRM into a single, actionable dashboard. The system features enrollment velocity indicators to flag events that need a marketing boost and provides a detailed breakdown of instrument SKUs purchased by each attendee, allowing instructors to tailor their training. This tool has streamlined instructor operations and gives our team much faster, more actionable insights, allowing us to make smarter decisions about resource allocation and marketing focus.",color:"from-blue-500/20 to-cyan-600/20",borderColor:"border-blue-500/30"},{id:"quote-payment-system",title:"Quote-to-Order System with Payment Plans",tagline:"A seamless, automated system that reduces sales friction and unlocks new revenue opportunities.",category:"E-commerce & Payments",icon:"CreditCard",technologies:["WooCommerce","Stripe","Gravity Forms","ACF","PHP"],timeline:"6 weeks",impact:"40% increase in high-value order close rates",why:"Our phone-based sales process was clunky and manual. High-value quotes for training bundles often stalled because of the friction involved in processing payments and the lack of flexible payment options. This was a direct barrier to closing significant sales.",value:"I architected an advanced quote-to-order system that transformed the sales process. The team can now generate a quote in a Gravity Form, which automatically creates a pending order in WooCommerce and sends a secure 'pay-by-link' to the customer. Crucially, I integrated Stripe to offer ACF-driven payment plans (from 3 to 18 months), making high-value packages much more accessible. This system has significantly increased our close rate on phone orders and lowered the operational overhead required to manage complex payment plans, directly contributing to top-line revenue growth.",color:"from-green-500/20 to-emerald-600/20",borderColor:"border-green-500/30"},{id:"provider-directory-analytics",title:"Provider Directory & Analytics Dashboard",tagline:"A data-driven dashboard that proves ROI and drives member retention.",category:"Analytics & Insights",icon:"BarChart3",technologies:["GA4 API","WordPress","Custom Analytics","CSV/PDF Export"],timeline:"4 weeks",impact:"25% increase in provider engagement",why:"Our provider directory was a key benefit for our members, but they had no way of knowing if it was actually working for them. We needed to move beyond simply providing a listing and start proving its value with concrete data. Without this proof, we faced a constant risk of churn.",value:"I built a custom analytics dashboard that syncs with the GA4 API to display key performance metrics for each provider's profile, including views, link clicks, top traffic sources, and weekly engagement trends. By providing clear, actionable insights and benchmarks against peer averages, this dashboard gives our providers undeniable proof of the ROI their membership delivers.

A messy Google Tag Manager container, legacy tags, and inconsistent event tracking meant our data was unreliable. We couldn't trust our attribution models, and our ad platforms were optimizing for the wrong signals, leading to wasted spend and missed opportunities.",value:"I led a complete revamp of our data layer and GTM container. I implemented a normalized event schema (e.g., gravityFormSubmission, purchaseCompleted) and used server-side PHP hooks to push clean, reliable data into GTM and GA4. I then reconfigured our ad platforms to optimize for high-intent signals only. This project resulted in a significant ROAS lift and a sharp reduction in false-positive conversions, giving our leadership team trustworthy data to make smarter, more profitable marketing decisions.",color:"from-indigo-500/20 to-purple-600/20",borderColor:"border-indigo-500/30"},{id:"training-lifecycle-automation",title:"Training Lifecycle Automation",tagline:"An end-to-end automated system that creates a seamless student journey from purchase to certification.",category:"Automation & Integration",icon:"Workflow",technologies:["WooCommerce","LearnDash","FluentCRM","WP Fusion","Gravity Forms"],timeline:"10 weeks",impact:"Near-zero certificate delays",why:"The student journey was fragmented and required significant manual intervention. Handoffs between a purchase in WooCommerce, enrollment in LearnDash, and segmentation in our CRM were inconsistent, leading to certificate delays and a poor user experience.",value:"I architected a fully integrated, end-to-end automation pipeline. Now, a single purchase in WooCommerce instantly triggers an enrollment in the correct LearnDash group, which then fires an evaluation form via Gravity Forms. Upon completion, the system logs the data, applies tags via WP Fusion into FluentCRM, and automatically makes the user's certificate available. This system has achieved a near-zero reduction in certificate delays and has led to a notable decrease in related support tickets, creating a frictionless and professional experience for our students.",color:"from-teal-500/20 to-cyan-600/20",borderColor:"border-teal-500/30"},{id:"edge-security-overhaul",title:"Edge Security Overhaul with Cloudflare",tagline:"A proactive, multi-layered defense strategy that neutralized threats, reduced server load, and enhanced performance.",category:"Security & Infrastructure",icon:"Shield",technologies:["Cloudflare","WAF","Rate Limiting","Bot Fight Mode","Edge Caching"],timeline:"4 weeks",impact:"85K+ malicious hits blocked monthly",why:"A high-traffic WordPress site was under constant siege from malicious bots, brute-force attacks, and scrapers. This invisible battle was causing significant server strain, creating security vulnerabilities, and risking the stability of our revenue-critical platform. We needed to move from a reactive, server-level defense to a proactive, edge-first security posture.",value:"I architected and implemented a comprehensive security overhaul using Cloudflare. This created a digital fortress that stopped threats before they could even reach our server. I deployed a WAF with custom firewall rules, implemented rate limiting on critical endpoints, and activated Bot Fight Mode, which now blocks over 85,000 malicious hits every month. By also implementing tiered caching with an 86% hit ratio, we not only hardened our security but also dramatically improved site performance.
